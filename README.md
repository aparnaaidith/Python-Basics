# Python-Basics
This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy words. If you have never programmed before click here to find out what programming is like and get started.
This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all or very little programming experience. 
You can use Python 3.3 or any newer Python with this tutorial. Don't use Python 2. If you write a Python 2 program now someone will need to convert it to Python 3 later, so it's best to just write Python 3 to begin with.
